mousejiggler
============

Mouse Jiggler is a very simple piece of software whose sole function is to "fake" mouse input to Windows, and 
jiggle the mouse pointer back and forth.

Useful for avoiding screensavers or other things triggered by idle detection that, for whatever reason, you 
can't turn off any other way; or as a quick way to stop a screensaver activating during an installation or 
when monitoring a long operation without actually having to muck about with the screensaver settings.

Installation
============

The easiest means of installing Mouse Jiggler is using Chocolatey, although bare releases continue to be available:

`choco install mouse-jiggler`

Operation

Features That Will Not Be Implemented
=====================================

This is a list of feature requests which I've decided won't be implemented in Mouse Jiggler for one reason or another, along with what those reasons are, just for reference:

 * Autorun on startup (because that's what the Startup group, Task Scheduler, etc. are for; it's inelegant to duplicate system facilities in a minimal app).
 * Timed startup/shutdown (again, Task Scheduler is for this).

Support
=======

Mouse Jiggler is a free product provided without warranty or support.
